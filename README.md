# Human-Tagger
Human Tagger is a WordPress plugin designed to create and manage a humans.txt file directly from the WordPress dashboard. It seamlessly integrates with the Site Editor (formerly Full Site Editing, FSE), allowing users to add metadata to their website's &lt;head> section, linking to a humans.txt file.
